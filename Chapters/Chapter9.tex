Accurate calibration of the output of the Gravitational Wave (GW) signal is 
essential to determine the physics parameters of the astronomical sources. 
This document has considered the design of the KAGRA photon calibrator.
KAGRA photon calibrator has a lot of unique points.
The 20 W high power laser give us the high frequency calibration lines and broad band injection signal.
The twin AOM technologies provide us the power control of two laser. This technologies can mitigate the elastic deformation and rotation method.
This study is an important contribution for world wide observation because the calibration accuracy of each interferometer is based on the combine analysis. 
The challenge now is to realize these possibility.
