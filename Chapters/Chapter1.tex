\section{Calibration of a Gravitational-Wave detector}

KAGRA is a laser interferometer using four mirrors (test masses) suspended 
from multi-stage pendulums to form two perpendicular optical cavities (arms).
Gravitation Wave (GW) strain causes differential variations of the arm length
and generates power fluctuations in the detector readout port. 
The power fluctuations measured by photodetectors work as the GW readout 
signal and an error signal to control the differential arm length. 
For the stable operation of the instrument, a feedback control of the 
differential arm length is required. This control is achieved by taking 
a digitized readout signal, applying a set of digital filters, and sending 
the control signal to the test mass actuators. Therefore, estimation 
of the equivalent GW strain sensed by the interferometer requires 
detailed characterization and correction for the feedback control loop.

The uncertainties are directly translated to the systematic errors on 
the absolute GW signal amplitude. In case of LIGO GW150914 event, 
the calibration was established to an uncertainty (1$\sigma$) of less than 
10\% in amplitude and 10 degrees in phase~\cite{GW150914}.
In case of LIGO GW151226 event, the calibration uncertainty (1$\sigma$) 
in both detectors at the time of the signal is better than 8\% 
in amplitude and 5 degrees in phase~\cite{GW151226}.

The calibration uncertainties also affect the coordinate reconstruction 
particularly in the case that only up to three detectors in the world 
GW detector network can detect the GW signal. This can often happen 
because the sensitivity of interferometer has directional dependence. 
The effect of calibration uncertainties is visible at high signal-to-noise 
ratio events where the angular resolution is less affected by the detector 
noise. In such cases, the pointing accuracy can get worse by factor of 
2$\sim$4 with 10\% calibration uncertainties~\cite{Klimenko}.

\section{Purposes of the photon calibrator}

Photon calibrators are the primary calibration tool in the Advanced LIGO 
and Advanced Virgo detectors~\cite{LIGO-CAL,Karki}. Earlier versions have 
been tested on various interferometers~\cite{Virgo-PCAL},
and they have evolved significantly in LIGO over the past ten 
years~\cite{Accadia,Clubley:2001,Mossavi:2006}.

There are several purposes for the photon calibrator:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Check of the sign of $h(t)$\\
Since the direction of the movement of test mass is proportional to the 
laser power, photon calibrator allows a direct check of the sign of the 
reconstructed $h(t)$ channel compared to the definition taken in agreement 
with other experiments. In initial phase of Virgo, he primary purpose of 
photon calibrator was to check the sign of h(t)~\cite{VIR-018}.

\item Calibration during the observing periods\\
Calibration methods without using photon calibrator such as using 
radio-frequency oscillator and laser wavelength can be done only under the 
limited condition where the interferometer is not operating in the optimum 
sensitivity. The propagation of calibration parameters from the high noise 
condition to the low noise condition can introduce additional unknown source 
of systematic errors. On the other hand, the photon calibrator is a completely 
independent instrument of the interferometer and therefore, actuate 
the test masses during the observation periods with optimum sensitivity. 

\item Hardware injection\\
Hardware injection in the high frequency region is important to verify the 
response of the detector system. Since actuators are inside the feedback 
control loop, the amplitude is more suppressed for higher frequencies. 
Photon calibrator can inject the high frequency signal more efficiently. 

\item Independence of calibration method
      and reliability assurance of interferometer\\

\end{enumerate}
