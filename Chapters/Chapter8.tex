Accurate calibration of the output of the Gravitational Wave (GW) signal is 
essential to determine the physics parameters of the astronomical sources. 
This document has considered the design of the KAGRA photon calibrator.
This study is an important contribution for world wide observation because the calibration accuracy of each interferometer is based on the combine analysis. 
The challenge now is to realize these possibility.
