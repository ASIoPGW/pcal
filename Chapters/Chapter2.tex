\section{Photon calibrator}
Photon calibrator relies on photon radiation pressure from auxiliary 
power-modulated laser beams reflecting on the test mass to apply periodic 
forces via the recoil of photons as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Pcal_intro}. Controlling and measuring the laser power 
accurately is one of the principal challenges of Pcal development. 
The KAGRA Pcal system consists of transmitter module, in-vacuum periscope, 
Receiver module and Beam monitor system as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Pcal_view}. The transmitter module accurately 
modulates the beam power with internal feedback loop called optical follower 
servo. Two laser beams from the transmitter module enter the vacuum enclosure 
and relayed by mirrors mounted to a periscope structure located inside the 
vacuum envelope, then impinge on the test mass mirror to apply forces. 
The reflected beams are relayed exactly in the symmetric path by the 
other set of mirrors mounted to the periscope and enter the receiver module. 
Capturing the beams reflected from the test mass is important to ensure 
that the applied power is exactly same as modulated without losing 
somewhere in the beam path.

An important aspect of the performance of the Pcal system is the locations 
of the beam spots on the test mass surface. The photon pressure forces can 
induce both local and bulk elastic deformations of the test mass which 
compromise the accuracy of the calibration. To minimize the impact of these 
deformations, Pcal uses two beams displaced symmetrically from the center 
of the face of the test mass mirror. In order to determine and adjust the 
positions of the Pcal beams, the beam position monitor system will be 
installed. It consists of remote-controlled digital camera, telescope and 
relay mirrors. It will also provide monitoring of the surface condition of 
the test mass mirror as well as the change of the test mass mirror position 
during the cooling down phase.

%One of the goals of the gravitational wave experiment is the accurate measurement of the gravitational waveform that is measured through the absolute displacement of the end test masses. A recent study that LIGO conducted in US showed that a displacement uncertainty could be controlled  by the photon calibrator. The photon calibrator is one of the calibration tools to push the mirror surface using the photon pressure of the laser as shown in Fig XXX.

The absolute displacement is described as
\begin{equation}
dx=\frac{2 P \cos{\theta}}{c} s(f) \left( 1+\frac{M}{I}\vec{a}\cdot \vec{b}\right), \label{eq:dx}
\end{equation}
where $P$ is an absolute power of the laser, $c$ is the speed of light, $\theta$  is an incident angle of the laser, $I$ and $M$ are moment of inertia and mass of test mass, $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ is position vector of photon calibrator lasers and interferometer laser. Then, $s(f)$ is transfer function of the test masses. The end test mass is suspended by the 14 m vibration isolation system as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:14m_VIS}.
We assumed the masses, shapes and Young's modules of the each pendulum mass and fiber. % as shown in Fig.XXX. 
We simulated the transfer function of 14 m cryogenic payroad as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:TF} . 
According to transfer function, we can regard the motion of high frequency as free mass due to higher than the natural frequency. Therefore, we are able to assume as follows:
\begin{equation}
s(f)=\frac{1}{M \omega^2},
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of test mass.

\end{figure}
The KAGRA Photon calibrator parameters, which are listed in Table~\ref{tab:KAGRA_spec}, we estimated the frequency dependence of maximum displacement 
in case of using full laser power to one frequency. 
Figure.~\ref{fig:kagra_pcal_displacement} is the result.
In this calculation, we assume the 25$\%$ of total laser power can use for mirror displacement, 
1/2 is caused by injecting waveform plus-minus, 
and remaining 1/2 is caused by pessimistic investigation of 
transmitter module optical efficiency(98.5$\%$ in LIGO) and
AOM diffraction efficiency(96$\%$ in LIGO).
The maximum displacement for each frequency can be written by 
\begin{equation}
3.7 \times 10^{-11}/f^2 {\rm   [m]}
\end{equation}

\section{Purpose of photon calibrator}
\subsection{Interferometer Calibration}\label{sec:darm_calib}

One of the main calibration method to reconstruct $\Delta L_{\rm ext}$, differenctial arm length (DARM), 
uses the combination of obtained error signal($d_{\rm err}$) and feedback signal($d_{\rm ctrl}$) 
with considering the slow temporal variations in 
aLIGO~\cite{LIGO-CAL,Tuyenbayev}.
%\footnote{The detail document is https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.05134.pdf}. 
In this document, we assume the LIGO DARM control system which is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:L_DARM_control_loop}.
%({\bf Ask experts how to control in bKAGRA, especially Actuator part}). 
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Figures/L_DARM_control_loop.eps}
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{Figures/DARM_loop_and_CAL.eps}
%\caption{Schematic diagram of the LIGO DARM control loop.}
\caption{Schematic diagram of the real-time interferometer differential 
arm (DARM) control loop and calibration pipeline adopted 
from~\cite{LIGO-CAL,Tuyenbayev}.}
\label{fig:L_DARM_control_loop} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}
This servo is described in term of 
(i) sensing function, $C(f,t)$ 
(ii) digital filters, $D(f)$ 
(iii)actuation function, $A(f,t)$, 
and $G(f,t) = C(f,t)D(f)A(f,t)$ is the DARM open loop transfer function  

The sensing function$C(f,t)$ can be written in
\begin{equation}
C(f,t) = \frac{\kappa_{\rm C}(t)}{1+if/f_{\rm C}(t)}Q(f) \equiv P(f,t) Q(f).
\end{equation}
$Q(f)$ is the time-independent part of the sensing function, which includes
photodetector response,
electronic response
and signal delay caused by light traveling time of interferometer arm.
$P(f,t)$ is the time-dependent part of the sensing function, which includes
optical gain sale factor, $\kappa_{\rm C}(t)$ and coupled-cavity response.
Coupled-cavity response is approximated by a single pole ($f_{\rm C}(t)$).

The actuation function$A(f,t)$ can be written in
\begin{equation}
A(f,t) = \kappa_{\rm M}(t)A_{\rm M,0}(f)+\kappa_{\rm I}(t)A_{\rm I,0}(f) + \kappa_{\rm T}(t) A_{\rm T,0}(f).
\end{equation}
$A_{\rm M,0}(f)$, $A_{\rm I,0}(f)$ and $A_{\rm T,0}(f)$ are models of the actuation function 
of the penultimate, upper-intermediate and the test mass stage 
when both $\kappa_{\rm M}(t_0)$, $\kappa_{\rm I}(t_0)$, and $\kappa_{\rm T}(t_0)$ are set to 1.

To monitor those four time variation parameters, 
$\kappa_{\rm C}(t)$, $f_{\rm C}(t)$, $\kappa_{\rm PU}(t)$ and $\kappa_{\rm T}(t)$, 
we need to inject modulated excitations into the DARM loop.
Also, to measure the $\kappa_{\rm C}(t)$ individually form $\kappa_{\rm M}(t)$,$\kappa_{\rm I}(t)$ and $\kappa_{\rm T}(t)$,
we need additional system to inject modulated excitations to ETM.
Photon calibrator is powerful tool for this purpose.
So, we should inject following four modulated excitations;
(i) five modulated excitations using a photon calibrator system ($x_{\rm pcal_i}$ ~($i=1,2,...,5$))
(ii) one modulated excitations into the overall DARM actuation ($x_{\rm ctrl}$)
(iii) one modulated excitations into the test mass stage actuation ($x_{\rm T}$).
The responses in $d_{\rm err}$ at time $t=t'$ for each modulated excitations can be written by
\begin{eqnarray}
d_{\rm err, t'}(f_{\rm pcal_i}) &=& \frac{C(f_{\rm pcal_i},t')}{1+G(f_{\rm pcal_i},t')} x_{\rm pcal_i} ~ (i=1,2, ..., 5) \\
d_{\rm err, t'}(f_{\rm ctrl}) &=& \frac{-A(f_{\rm ctrl}, t')C(f_{\rm ctrl},t')}{1+G(f_{\rm ctrl},t')} x_{\rm ctrl}  \\
d_{\rm err, t'}(f_{\rm T}) &=& \frac{\kappa_{\rm T}(t') A_{\rm T,0}(f_{\rm T}, t')C(f_{\rm T},t')}{1+G(f_{\rm T},t')} x_{\rm T} 
\end{eqnarray}
Using $x_{\rm pcal2}$ and $x_{\rm T}$ modulated excitations, $\kappa_{\rm T}(t')$ is obtained.
Using $x_{\rm ctrl}$ modulated excitation and $\kappa_{\rm T}(t')$, $\kappa_{\rm M}(t')$,$\kappa_{\rm I}(t')$ and $A(f,t')$ are obtained. 
Using $x_{\rm pcal1}$ and $x_{\rm pcal3}$ modulated excitation and $A(f,t')$, $\kappa_{\rm C}(t')$ and $f_{\rm C}(t')$ are obtained.
Using $x_{\rm pcal4}$ and $x_{\rm pcal5}$ modulated excitations, high frequency transfer function is obtained.

Finally, $h(t)$ is reconstructed by following equation:
\begin{eqnarray}
h(t)=\frac{\Delta L_{\rm ext}(t)}{L} &= &{\cal C} ^{-1} * d_{\rm err}(t)/L  +  {\cal A}* d_{\rm ctrl}(t)/L ,
\end{eqnarray}
where ${\cal P}(f_{\rm C}(t))$, ${\cal Q}$, ${\cal A_{\rm P,0}}$, ${\cal A_{\rm U,0}}$ and ${\cal A_{\rm T,0}}$  
are the time-domain filters created from $P(f,t)$, $Q(f)$, $A_{\rm M,0}(f)$, $A_{\rm I,0}(f)$ and $A_{\rm T,0}(f)$, and $*$ denotes convolution.

To reduced the systematic uncertainty, frequencies of modulated excitations are selected with following conditions:
(1) Frequency of $x_{\rm pcal1}$ should be much less than coupled-cavity pole frequency.
(2) Frequencies of $x_{\rm pcal2}$ , $x_{\rm ctrl}$ and $x_{\rm T}$ should be in a narrow frequency band.
(3) Such frequency band should be selected where the magnitude of the transfer functions of 
the combined penultimate and upper intermediate mass stage and the test mass stage are 
approximately equal.
(4) Frequencies of $x_{\rm pcal3}$ should be near the coupled-cavity pole frequency.


\subsection{Hardware injection test}
Hardware injection test is one of the important end-to-end test which 
inject various waveforms to end test mass.
To analyze the hardware injection test data, we perform 
detector performance, data acquisition system, calibration system, 
data transfer system, data analysis pipeline.
We can obtain the waveforms with detector response, so 
various information will be obtained through hardware injection test.
\begin{itemize}
\item test of calibration system\\
We can test the strain signal calibration accuracy of 
sign, amplitude, phase and timing.
\item check of analysis tools\\
To inject the gravitational wave signals such as inspiral signal from 
compact binary coalescence, we can check the analysis tools/pipeline 
and systematic error due to calibration accuracy.
\item injection of complex signals\\
To inject complex signals such as supernovae waveform, Cosmic string waveform, ringdown waveform, 
we can judge that complex signals can observe correctly or not. 
If we understood that there are un-observable signal, we can consider the update of observation scenario or
calibration system.
\item blind injection\\
\end{itemize}
When we apply hardware injection test, it will be better to inject signal without DARM control loop.
%The reasons are (i) limited by the fluctuation of feedback signals (ii) uncertainty of actuation efficiency
%(iii) uncertainty of higher frequency injection 
%(We don't know higher frequency injection by actuator works well or not.)
%Photon calibrator is also powerful tool for hardware injection test.
%To measure the laser power and to check the performance of AOM, we achieved the accurate hardware injection test.
Ensure that there is no mistake (mis-understandings) in injection test 
when we check and confirm the calibration system.
In case of that there are two mis-understandings in injection test and calibration system, 
we sometimes miss those mis-understandings due to counteract each other. 
Reducing the systematic uncertainty especially for injection system is crucial.
Injection test itself is possible without photon calibrator, 
but there are advantages to have injection test with photon calibrator
\begin{enumerate}
\item Injection test by photon calibrator is simpler than other injection system\\
\item We can injection test outside of DAEM main loop\\
The counteract by two-misunderstanding can be reduced in photon calibrator.
But we should take into account common system, such as DAC/AI filters\\
\item Inject signals without considering feedback signals\\
We don't need to consider the saturation in DAC, and the advantage of larger amplitude injection 
because we don't take into account fluctuation of feedback signals.\\
\item Dis-advantage of photon calibrator.\\
We didn't establish the cross check of photon calibrator injection completely. 
There are mis-matching between photon calibrator and other injection methods.
Multiple approach of injection test will be important for the future calibration/injection tests. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Calibration line of KAGRA}
At least one PCAL calibration line is needed as a standard candle 
for the DARM actuator calibration, and 
another line for each of the suspension stages that will be used for DARM 
actuation. In case of LIGO it has been made to do thus far with 1/2 
as many lines as interferometer response parameters to intend to track, 
because one can use the amplitude and phase for each line to obtain two 
parameters. If we need to track the optical gain and coupled cavity pole 
frequency (without Signal Recycling Cavity (SRC) detuning) then we will 
need one line. If we need to track those as well as the SRC detuning spring 
frequency and factor Q, we will need 2 lines.

In the O1/O2 phase of LIGO, the interferometer configuration is made without 
SRC detuning, or called Extreme Resonant Sideband Extraction (ERSE) 
where the microscopic SRC phase is 90 deg.
In this case, the optomechanical response can be approximated by a single pole,

\begin{equation}
C_{ERSE}(f) = \frac{g}{1+{\rm i}f/p}
\end{equation}

Where $f$ is the frequency, $g$ is the optical gain, and $p$ is coupled 
cavity pole frequency, $p=f_a\times(1+r_s)/(1-r_s) =$ 365 Hz.
In case of LIGO, $f_a=cT_i/8\pi L = $42 Hz and $r_s=\sqrt{1-T_s}$ 
with transmissivity of Input Test Mass (ITM) and Signal Recycling Mirror (SRM) 
as $T_i=0.014$ and $T_s=0.37$~\cite{OptSpringCal}.

In case of KAGRA, the design values of $T_i=0.004$ and $T_s=0.1536$ give 
the coupled cavity pole frequency $p=$ 387 Hz. One calibration line around 
this frequency should be added to track the optical gain and the cavity pole 
frequency.

As discussed in Section.~\ref{sec:darm_calib}, we need at least five calibration lines with following characteristics:
\begin{enumerate}
\item five pcal calibration line ($x_{\rm pcal1,2,3,4,5}$) with $\sim$7Hz,$\sim$35Hz,$\sim$330Hz,$\sim$1000Hz  and $\sim$2000Hz. 
\item one calibration line to feedback signal ($x_{\rm ctrl}$) with $\sim$35Hz.
\item one calibration line to end test mass ($x_{\rm T}$) with $\sim$35Hz.
\end{enumerate}
More, to monitor the calibration accuracy and open loop transfer function,
it will be better to add at least four calibration line (two for pcal and two for feedback), 
frequencies will be $\sim$100Hz and $\sim$1000Hz.

We summarized the current calibration line as shown in Table.~\ref{tab:Cal_line} and Fig.~\ref{fig:Pcal_line_curve}.

The total laser power with photon calibration can be calculated by following equation
\begin{equation}
P_{\rm laser} = \sum_i \sqrt{2} L S_n(f_i) \frac{1}{4} \frac{{\rm SNR}(f_i)}{\sqrt{T}} \frac{Mc(2 \pi f_i)^2}{2 \cos \theta}, 
\end{equation}
where $f_i$ is i-th calibration line frequency, 
$L$ is arm length, $S_n(f_i)$ is sensitivity curve [strain(rms)/rHz], 
$\sqrt{2}$ corresponds to conversion coefficients from peak value to effective value, 
SNR($f_i$) is required signal to noise ratio, 
$T_i$ is length of Fourier transform, 
$M$ is mirror mass,
$c$ is light speed.
