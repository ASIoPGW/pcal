\section{Layout of Photon calibrator}
The KAGRA photon calibrator is placed around EXA/EYA chamber, which is installed 36 m away from the end test mass (ETM). We push the mirror surface with the modulated photon pressure directly. Figure \ref{fig:Pcal_overview} shows the layout of the KAGRA photon calibrator. The photon calibrator consists of transmitter module (Tx module), receiver module (Rx module), periscope, and telephoto camera module (TCam module). We place the 20~W laser in Tx module, whose frequency is 1047 nm. The 1064 nm laser is not used due to avoid the coupling with main beams.   The power of the laser is modulated by the optical follower servo (OFS). We split the beams in Tx module for pushing the drum head node points of the ETM due to elastic deformation. We transfer the beams to the ETM though the periscope. All the periscope structures are placed into the EXA/EYA chamber. The beam is received by the Rx module. We place a 6 inches integrating sphere for the accurate measurement of the laser power and two quadrant photo detector (QPD) for the beam position monitor. We also measure the beam position on the ETM surface using the telephoto camera (TCam). The Tcam is consists of the astronomical telescope, focuser, and high resolution digital camera.  Details of instruments are described following section.

\section{Transmitter (Tx) module}
The Tx module is placed at the side of the EXA/EYA chamber. Figure~\ref{fig:Tx_module_overview} shows the view of Transmitter module. All the optical components are mounted on the $900~\mathrm{mm}\times  900~\mathrm{mm}$ breadboard (B9090L; Thorlabs). The bread board is placed on the support structure. The electrical module for the control and readout are also hosed in the support structure.

\subsection{Fiber laser}
We employ the CW fiber laser made by the LER photonics as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Laser}. The maximum power and frequency are 20 W and 1047 nm, respectively. The model number of the laser is CYFL-TERA-20-LP-1047-AM1-RGO-OM1-T305-C1. The maximum laser power of KAGRA Pcal is 10 times larger than that of LIGO. This is because that we need the high power laser for the injection test and photon pressure actuator technique. The typical beam width of the laser is 0.5~mm when we mount the isolator. We summarize the specification of the laser as shown in Table~\ref{tab:Laser_spec}.

\subsection{Beam shutter}
We have to pay attention to safety for the operation of the high power laser. In order to dump the beam, we use the beam shutter made by lasermet company. The model number of the shutter is LS-10-12. The aperture size and  Max laser power are 15 mm and 20 W. These number meet our requirement due to the laser spot size and maximum power. We control the beam shutter on the GUI. The specification of the beam shutter is shown in Table.~\ref{tab:Beam_shutter_spec}.

\subsection{Half wave plate}
To control the polarization angle of incident beam, we employ the zero order half wave plate (HWP) made by the CVI laser optics. The model number of the HWP is QWPO-1047-05-2-R10 whose diameter are 12.7mm. The HWP is mounted on the rotation mount made by Thorlabs. The thick ness are optimized at 1047 nm.
The specification of the HWP is listed in Table~\ref{tab:HWP_spec}.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Polarizer}
We place two polarizers to define the polarization angle accurately. This is because that the power of the laser is modulated by acousto-optic modulator (AOM) whose performance strongly depend on the incident polarization angle.
One polarizer is placed behind HWP. Another one is placed after AOM. The Polarizer is made by Karl-Lambrecht. We purchased TFPC12-1047 that is optimized at 1047 nm. 
\subsection{Lens}
We have dane a mode matching simulation using JamMt. We assumed laser beam to be gaussian distribution. We have to place the focus of the laser at the AOM. Thus, we decide the optimal position and focal length of the 1 inch lens (L1), where the assumed beam waist of the fiber laser and AOM are 0.5 mm and XXX mm, respectively. 
Furthermore, we place two lenses for placing the focus at the surface of the ETM. We employ the combination of 1 inch negative lens and 2 inch positive lens. The Gaussian beam can describe the following relation:
\begin{equation}
w(z)=\omega_0\sqrt{1+\left( \frac{\lambda z}{\pi \omega_0^2}\right)^2},
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is wavelength of the laser, $w_0$ is beam waist, $z$ is direction from the focus. We estimate the minimum differential beam spot by changing beam waist because it make the alignment easier. The minimum beam spot is written by 
\begin{equation}
\left .\frac{dw(z)}{dw_0} \right|_{z=36m}=0.
\end{equation}
The estimated beam waist and beam spot is 3.5 mm and 5.5 mm as shown in Fig. XXXX.
We also place the lens at the front of the photo detector for the OFS. The parameters of the simulation results are listed in Table.~\ref{tab:Tx_lenses_spec}. All lenses are made by CVI laser optics. The material of lenses are fused silica. The AR coating is placed at both surface.

\end{table}

\subsection{Mirror}
We employ nine 1 inch mirrors and four 2 inch mirrors. The 1 inch mirror is made by CVI laser optics. They place the HR coating on the surface of mirror. On the other hand, we use the HR coating on the fused silica disc of 2 inch in diameter. The coating and polishing the fused silica is made by Sigma-koki corporation. The reflectance of the mirror is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Tx_module_layout}.
 The reflectance of HR coating depends on the incident angle and the polarization angle. We labeled mirrors as M-Tx1 toM-Tx-11, M-Tx-t-1,M-Tx-t-2, and M-Tx-b-1. The specification of mirrors are summarized in Table.\ref{tab:Tx_mirror_spec}. All mirror is aligned with optical mirror mount made by Newport company.

\subsection{Optical mount with Pico-motor}
The uncertainty of the beam position on the ETM is one of the largest.
To control the beam position, we employ the Pico-motor after flip mirrors for changing mirror angle. 
The pico-motor is made by New port, whose part number is 8822. 

\subsection{Beam splitter}
To reduce the elastic deformation, we separate the beam with the beam splitter made by CVI laser optics for pushing the node points of mirror. The part number of beam splitter is BS1-1064-50-2025-45P. The diameter of the beam splitter is 2 inch. Table~\ref{tab:BS_spec} shows the separation ratio of beam splitter.

\subsection{Optical follower servo}
In order to achieve low-noise and accurate modulation, an active controller (servo) can modulate the waveform by means of feedback control. This feedback loop used for the Pcal is called as the Optical Follower Servo.
The Optical Follower Servo will be used in the KAGRA Photon Calibrator as a means to reduce the relative power noise (RPN) of the laser. We will achieve maximum sideband to carrier suppression of the modulated output waveform. 

\subsection{Photo detector}
To detect the laser power, we use the photo detector. We place the photodetector at the working standard, Optical follower sarvo, Integrating sphere in Tx and Rx module.
We developed the photo detector as shown in Fig.xxx. We employ the InGaAs photo diode for absolute power measurement. The InGaAs diode is placed on the circuit board. The beam is collimated for the power detection reasonably. 

\subsubsection{Cover}
The design of the cover is done by LIGO Pcal group. We make the detector cover in Academia Sinica, Institute of Physics. Figure~\ref{fig:detector_cover} shows the machined detector covers. We housed the circuit board into the cover coated by the black anodized aluminum.

\subsubsection{InGaAs detector}	
We employ the C30665GH, large area InGaAs PIN photodiode with diameter of 3.0 mm with a flat glass window. The C30665GH provides high quantum efficiency from 800nm to 1700nm. This detector is fabricated by Excelitas. The specification of detector is shown in Table.~\ref{tab:detector_spec}.

\subsubsection{Electrical Circuit}
We newly improved the electrical circuit of the photon detector as shown in Fig, \ref{fig:Photo_detector}. The electrical circuit is housed in the aluminum cover. We place the photo detector at the the behind of the electrical circuit. The layers of the circuit consists of 4 layer. We change the differential gain by changing the register and capacitor of the circuit. The electrical circuit are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Detector_circuit}.

\subsection{Beam sampler}
\subsection{2 inch integrating sphere}
The 2 inches integrating sphere is used for absolute power measurement of the laser. We receive the separated laser beam at beam sampler. We mount the photo detector at the port of integrating sphere. The integrating sphere is made by the Lab sphere. The inner surface of the integrating sphere in mounted on the Spectralon.

\subsection{Structure}
The breadboard is placed on the support structure. The material of this structure is SUS 306. This structure can be housed electrical devices, such as driver of the fiber laser, electronics of optical follower servo, and driver of laser shutter. We simulated the resonance frequency using ANSYS. The estimated frequency is XXX Hz.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Periscope}
The periscope is used for sending the beams to ETM. We place the periscopes in EXA/EYA chamber as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Periscope_overview}.
They consist of four periscopes. The first periscope is mounted at the vacuum side of the window. The laser is send to second periscope on optical table. We share one first mirror and one second mirror for the two beams of the laser. We send the two laser to two third periscope. The third periscope is sent to fourth periscope, which is aligned to same hight of the injected beam to the ETM.

\label{fig:Periscope_overview} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Geometric optics}
We consider the beam separation and focus position of the optical system for the laser to be sent and received to the ETM. We fixed 80~mm separation of the mirror in transmitter module.  Figure XXX shows the schematic view of optical layout, where $D_{win}$, $D_{m2}$, and $D_{m3}$ are separation of beams, $L_{win}$, $L_{m2}$, and $L_{m3}$ are distance of each components.  We calculated the beam separation of the vacuum window, second mirror, and third mirrors by changing the focus point as shown in Fig. XXXX. X axis shows the distance from the window. We find a optimal point of minimum separation of the window because of clear aperture of window and second mirror. The optimal focus point is at XXXX mm from the window corresponding to XXXX separation of the mirror. We also find a incident angle of window with optimal focus point as 1.6 degree.
\subsection{View window}
One of the serious systematic errors are optical efficiency of the view port. Therefore, we have to reduce the reflectance of  view port at least 0.1 \%. We employ the fused silica optical window whose diameter and thickness are 100 mm and 0.5 inch. We place the AR coating on both surfaces of the window. Figure XXX shows the simulated transmittance of the view port. The effective diameter of the view port is about 3 inch. The incident angle of the beams are 1.6 degree. We mounted the first periscope at the vacuum side of the window because we should avoid optical lever path. We set the incident angle of periscope mirror as 50 degrees.

The flange type of the view port is ICF152. We remodeled the blank flange of ICF 152 made by Cosmotech. Figure ~\ref{fig:Pcal_window} shows the drawing of the view port. We employ the G-85 o-ring for vacuum sealing. 

\subsection{Mirrors}
We employ eight 3 inch mirrors. We place the HR coating on the polished fused silica disc. The coating and polishing the fused silica is made by Sigma-koki corporation. The reflectance of the mirror is shown in Figure. XXXX.
 The reflectance of HR coating depends on the incident angle and the polarization angle. We labeled mirrors as M1, XXXX. The specification of mirrors are summarized in Table.~\ref{tab:Periscope_mirror_spec}. All mirror is aligned with optical mirror mount made by XXXXXX.

\subsection{6inch Integrating sphere}
The 6 inches integrating sphere is used for absolute power measurement of the laser. We receive the laser beam from two paths. To receive the power perfectly, we need a sufficiently large diameter hole of integrating sphere. We use for the 2 inch hole integrating sphere. We mounted the photo detector at the top of port. Details of the photo detector is explained in XXXXX.

\subsection{Mirror}
We employ four 2 inch mirrors. We place the HR coating made by Siguma-koki as shown in Fig. XXXX. For two mirrors, we make the AR coating on the back surface to pick up the beams. The specification of the mirrors are listed in Table~\ref{tab:Rx_mirror_spec}.

\section{Camera module}
The beam position of the ETM surface corresponds to systematic error of the rotation and elastic deformation. To measure the beam position, we measure the mirror surface directly. However, the KAGRA EXA/EYA chambers are placed at 36m far from the ETM. Thus, we employ the combination of telescope and high resolution camera, we call telephoto camera (TCam). We are tuning with focus point of the mirror using focuser.  We place the view port and mirror between the ETM and TCam. Figure XXX shows the drawing of TCam unit.
\subsection{Camera}
Purpose of using the high resolution camera, we have to measure the beam position within 1 mm accuracy. Ww solved this problem by D810 digital camera made by Nikon. The D810 reprises the 36-megapixel resolution with $35.9 \times 24.0~\mathrm{mm}$ CMOS sensor. We remove the IR filter because the commercial camera is not sensitive to laser wavelength (1047 nm).
\subsection{Telescope}
We employ the Maksutov-Cassegrain type telescope for observing the ETM surface. The diameter of the primary mirror is 127 mm and its focal length is 1500 mm ($f/12$). The telescope is manufactured by Sky-watcher company. The diameter of the telescope is limited by the that of the view window size. 
\subsection{Focuser}
A focuser, which is made by Moonlight, is used for the automatic focus control. 
We connect focuser between telescope and camera. The model number is XXXXX.
\subsection{View window}
The flange type of the view port is ICF203. We remodeled the blank flange of ICF 203 made by Cosmotech. Figure~\ref{fig:Camera_window} shows the drawing of the view port. We employ the G-135 o-ring for vacuum sealing.
