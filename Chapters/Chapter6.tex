One of the serious systematic error is beam position
We are developing Beam position monitor (BPM) for accurate measurement of beam position.
Previous study in LIGO have achieved 0.3~\% of uncertainty by using Telephoto camera system.
They place the telephoto camera at 8~m far from the ETM. On the other hand, That of KAGRA is 36 m where is 4.5 times larger. Therefore, one of the most difficult technologies of calibration is beam position measurement.

We will demonstrate the system of BMS as  the new technology. The BMS system is consists of XXXX parts as shown in Fig.XXXX.
