\section{Photon stimulator}
We can apply the photon calibrator technologies for photon pressure actuator.
Then, we need to inject four laser at the node circle of the end test mass.

\section{Optical lever}
We place the QPDs on the receiver module. So, we can use the photon calibrator as displacement and angle sensing optical lever.
We expect to decouple the displacement and rotation effect by using two beams.
